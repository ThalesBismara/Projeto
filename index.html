            <h2>How to Make It</h2>
            <p>
                In a blender, blend the water, instant coffee, eggs, oil, sugar, and cocoa powder until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the flour and baking powder, and mix with a spoon. Pour the batter into cupcake liners placed in a large baking tray, side by side. Bake in a preheated medium oven for about 25 minutes or until baked through and golden. Remove and let cool.<br>

                For the filling, place all the ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until thickened. Remove from heat, let cool, and transfer to a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Set aside. Place the whipped cream in another piping bag fitted with a star tip and set aside.<br><br>

                To assemble, make a hole in the center of each cupcake and fill with the reserved coffee brigadeiro. Decorate the tops of the cupcakes with the reserved whipped cream, piping in circular motions. Garnish with coffee beans and refrigerate until ready to serve.
